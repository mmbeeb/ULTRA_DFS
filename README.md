# ULTRA_DFS

I created ULTRA DFS in 2015.  (Last modification was 28/06/2016.)

It was an attempt to combine MMFS and real DFS but never caught on.  Thus it was never fully debugged.

It is assembled using BeebAsm.

Original versions of DFS roms:

DNFS (DFS 1.20 + NFS 3.60): beebasm -i dnfs.asm

DFS 2.24: beebasm -i dfs224.asm

DFS 2.26: beebasm -i dfs226.asm

------

Ultra versions:

DFS 1.20: beebasm -i ultra120.asm

DFS 2.25: beebasm -i ultra224.asm

DFS 2.26:beebasm -i ultra226.asm
